# Introduction to R - Part 1

## I. Please **study the contents** and **work through all the code** within the following lessons:

1.1 [Introduction to R and RStudio](../lessons/01_introR-R-and-RStudio.md)
    <details>
        <br>R is a programming language and larger system for data analysis, and RStudio is the most popular to use R. <br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>
            - The definitions of R and RStudio<br>
            - How to interact with R and RStudio<br>
            - How to setup a new R project<br><br>
    </details>

1.2 [R Syntax and Data Structure](../lessons/02_introR-syntax-and-data-structures.md)
    <details>
        <br>In order to utilize R effectively, you will need to understand what types of data you can use in R and also how you can store data in "objects" or "variables". <br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>
            - Assigning a value to a object<br>
            - What types of information can you store in R<br>
            - What are the different objects that you can use to store data in R<br><br>
    </details>

1.3 [Functions and Arguments](../lessons/03_introR-functions-and-arguments.md)
    <details>
        <br>Functions are the basic "commands" used in R to get something done. To use functions (denoted by function_name followed by "()"), one has to enter some information within the parenthesis and optionally some arguments to change the default behavior of a function. 
        <br>You can also create your own functions! When you want to perform a task or a series of tasks more than once, creating a custom function is the best way to go. 
        <br><br>In this lesson you will explore:<br>
        - Using built-in functions<br>
        - Creating your own custom functions<br><br>
    </details>

1.4 [Reading in and inspecting data](../lessons/06_reading_and_data_inspection.md)
    <details>
        <br>When using R, it is almost a certainty that you will have to bring data into the R environment. <br><br>In this lesson you will learn:<br>
        - Reading different types (formats) of data<br>
        - Inspecting the contents and structure of the dataset once you have read it in<br><br>
    </details>
