# Introduction to R - Part 3

## I. Please **study the contents** and **work through all the code** within the following lessons:

3.1. [Plotting with the ggplot2 package](../lessons/11_ggplot2.md)
      <details>
          <br>One of the greatest advantages of R is its ability to create detailed plots and data visualizations.<br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>
            - Visualizing data using ggplot2<br>
            - Customizing the appearance of plots<br>
        </details>
        
 3.2 [Using custom functions for consistent plots](../lessons/11b_Custom_Functions_ggplot2.md)
      <details>
          <br>When creating your plots in ggplot2 you may want to have consistent formatting (using <code>theme()</code> functions) across your plots, e.g. if you are generating plots for a manuscript. <br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>
            - Developing a custom function for creating consistently formatted plots<br>
        </details>

3.3 [Generating a boxplot with ggplot2](../lessons/12_boxplot_exercise.md)
    <details>
        <br>Previously, you created a scatterplot using ggplot2. However, ggplot2 can be used to create a very wide variety of plots. One of the other frequently used plots you can create with ggplot2 is a barplot.<br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>
            - Creating and customizing a barplot using ggplot2<br>
        </details>

3.4 [Writing to file and exporting plots](../lessons/13_exporting_data_and_plots.md)
        <details>
            <br>Now that you have completed some analysis in R, you will need to eventually export that work out of R/RStudio. R provides lots of flexibility in what and how you export your data and plots.<br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>
            - Exporting your figures from R using a variety of file formats<br>
            - Writing your data from R to a file<br>
        </details>

3.5 [Finding help](../lessons/14_finding_help.md)
        <details>
            <br>Hopefully, this course has given you the basic tools you need to be successful when using R. However, it would be impossible to cover every aspect of R and you will need to be able to troubleshoot future issues as they arise.<br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>
            - Suggestions for how to best ask for help<br>
            - Where to look for help<br>
        </details>

3.6 [Tidyverse](../lessons/15_tidyverse.md)
        <details>
            <br>The <a href="https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/articles/paper.html">Tidyverse suite of integrated packages</a> are designed to work together to make common data science operations more user friendly. Tidyverse is becoming increasingly prevalent and it is necessary that R users are conversant in the basics of Tidyverse. We have already used two Tidyverse packages in this workshop (<code>ggplot2</code> and <code>purrr</code>) and in this lesson we will learn some key features from a few additional packages that make up Tidyverse. <br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>
            - Usage of pipes for connecting together multiple commands<br>
            - Tibbles for two-dimensional data storage<br>
            - Data wrangling within Tidyverse <br>
        </details>

## II. **Complete the exercises**:
   * Note that some exercises assume you have variables in your environment from the lessons. 
   * [Practice exercises III](../activities/Day4_activities.md)
   * **Copy over** your code from the exercises into a text file. 
   * **Upload the saved text file** to [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/request/LLfZwISqJfZGEale3Wx3).
