# Introduction to R

## Learning Objectives

1. **R syntax**: Understand the different 'parts of speech'.
2. **Data types structures in R**: Describe the various data types and data structures.
3. **Data inspection and wrangling**: Demonstrate the utilization of functions and indices to inspect and subset data from various data structures.
4. **Visualizing data**: Demonstrate the use of the ggplot2 package to create plots for easy data visualization.

## How to Get Help

The fastest way to get help is to use the workshop's Slack workspace, which you can join using [this link](https://join.slack.com/t/ccb-intro-to-r/shared_invite/zt-1j8e9rmb7-P~1dQGuSGlwIUS6wedB8bw).

In the slack you can ask questions, answer questions asked by other participants, and get other support and resources. I will do my best to answer all questions within 24 hours, typically much faster, but helping to answer questions posted by other participants will also aid you in your learning. 

You can also feel free to [send an email](mailto:christopher_magnano@hms.harvard.edu) or attend office hours (specific office hour times will be emailed and advertised on slack). If you cannot make office hours, we can set up an alternate time to meet. 

## Installations

Download the most recent versions of R and RStudio:

 - [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) 
 - [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

## Overview

This workshop consists of 3 parts. Each part has a set of lessons and exercises. 
In Part I will you will learn the syntax of the R programming language and basic functionality such as file I/O and data structures. 
In Part II you will learn how to manipulate, wrangle, and subset data. 
In Part III you will learn how to create data visualizations, get help, and be introduced to the R Tidyverse set of packages. 

In addition to the text lessons with accompanying code examples, we will also be making use of the [R Catalyst Introduction to R Online Resource](https://catalyst.harvard.edu/courses/intro-to-r/). 
These are a set of video lessons and materials which parallel the structure of the main workshop, and require a Harvard Key login to access. 
Relevant video links are provided for each lesson as a supplement to the main workshop.
These videos provide a slightly different perspective on the workshop materials and allow you to vary your learning between reading and watching/listening.
